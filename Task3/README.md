# Logging
**Logging is configured to write INFO level messages and above to a file named log.log. <br/>**

**A logger object is created using logging.getLogger(__name__). Additionally, a decorator is applied to functions to automatically log their calls and results.<br/>**

**The @wraps(fn) decorator ensures the wrapper retains the original functionâ€™s metadata.**
